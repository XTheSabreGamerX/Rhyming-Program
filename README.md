# Rhyming-Program
This program was my first breather in while (AKA I coded this pretty quickly and works like a charm!). In this program, it detects if the first and second word manages to have a rhyming last two letters. Although there are some funky logic such as beat and treat not rhyming, but I made this program with the given instructions to me in mind lol.
